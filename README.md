This topology serves as an illustration of a collapsed core Local Area Network (LAN) architecture. 

The central aspect of this demonstration involves the deployment of a FastAPI framework, which enables the creation of REST-APIs. 

These APIs cater to an interactive User Interface (UI), facilitating seamless network management and administration.

In tandem, the lab employs the Netmiko library to establish Secure Shell (SSH) connections as the Southbound Interface (SBI) for communication with network devices. 

The lab underscores the practical implementation of automation tools, bolstering network efficiency and operational agility example configuring VLANs,DHCP etc.
